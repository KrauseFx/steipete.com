## PSPDFKit

I founded and bootstrapped [PSPDFKit](http://pspdfkit.com), an SDK for working with PDF files on any platform. I was CEO 2011-2019 and now focus on researching new products and technologies. My latest fun project was shipping [PDF Viewer via Mac Catalyst](https://pdfviewer.io/).

## Speaking

I speak at various conferences around the world, and most recently I was in Buenos Aires, Berlin, Paris, and New York. For speaking engagements, check out my [speaking schedule](https://github.com/steipete/speaking/blob/master/README.md).
