Peter founded and bootstrapped [PSPDFKit](http://pspdfkit.com) in 2011, and in the time since, has grown the company to 50 employees. PSPDFKit’s goal is to provide the highest quality PDF framework for all platforms. He stepped down as CEO in late 2019 and moved to a research role to focus on new products and technologies. His latest mission is becoming an expert in Apple’s Project Catalyst.

Peter has worked with iOS since the inception of the iPhone, and is regularly invited to [speak at conferences](https://github.com/steipete/speaking/blob/master/README.md) around the world. He also organizes [Cocoaheads Austria](https://cocoaheads.at/), a meetup for developers who work with Apple platforms.

Prior to PSPDFKit, he worked as a Senior iOS Engineer at a startup in San Francisco and taught iOS and Mac development at his alma mater, the Vienna University of Technology.
