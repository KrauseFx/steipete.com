# Definition

>iOS jailbreaking is a privilege escalation to remove software restrictions imposed by Apple on iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. This is done through a series of kernel patches. This jailbreaking allows root access to iOS, allowing the downloading and installing of additional applications and extensions which are unavailable through the official Apple App Store.

# State of Jailbreaking

It has never been a better time for jailbreaking. From iOS 10-13, almost every version can be hacked.

Reddit has a great overview: [Can I jailbreak my device?](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/escapeplan/guides/jailbreakcharts#wiki_ios13.x)

- [checkra1n](https://checkra.in/) uses the [Checkm8 exploit](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/09/developer-of-checkm8-explains-why-idevice-jailbreak-exploit-is-a-game-changer/) - an unpatchable vulnerability in the  iOS bootrom for all devices from A5-A11 (everything up to iPhone X)

- [unc0ver](https://unc0ver.dev/), a semi-untethered jealbreak using various hacks.They recently announced compatibility with iOS 13.5, the current shipping os as of the time writing this post.
