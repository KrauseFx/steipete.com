# Definition

>iOS jailbreaking is a privilege escalation to remove software restrictions imposed by Apple on iOS, tvOS, and watchOS. This is done through a series of kernel patches. This jailbreaking allows root access to iOS, allowing the downloading and installing of additional applications and extensions which are unavailable through the official Apple App Store.
