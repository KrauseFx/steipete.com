A good story is nuanced, complicated, contains surprise twists and a happy ending. Me owning an LG UltraFine 5K delivers in all of that.

# Background
I own one of the [cursed](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/02/03/macos-display-problems/) LG UltraFine 5K Displays. In fact I don't just own one, I own about 10 of them.

Yes. I realize now that blindly trusting that Apple hardware is good, is a mistake. We've been having issues with [ghosting](https://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/a2vf8i/lg_5k_ultrafine_ghosting/), [Wi-Fi Interference issues](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/15/lg-ultrafine-5k-shielding-fixed/) and also compatibility issues - there's no HDMI, DisplayPort or similar. Only way to use them is a modern Mac[^1]. The last issue was a known tradeoff and acceptable. The benefit of only having a single cable as a modern docking station and a beautiful panel did outweigh these drawbacks. I still remember my innocent excitement:

We've been returning most of the displays to get fixes for various issues, and patiently been updating the firmware multiple times with LG's crappy [Screen Manager](https://lgcommunity.us.com/discussion/2864/ultrafine-5k-lg-screen-manager-firmware) software.

With the 2017-generation of MacBooks, I had particular fun, since plugging in the LG was causing graphic issues on the Mac Display: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now this is happening on the second gen MacBook Pro. (Even better, during an important video call)<br>I tried to ping Apple support but I just donâ€™t have the time/energy to go through that drama again.

I've been writing radars, calling Apple Support, even taking a cab and driving to a repair center (this was before Austria had Apple Stores). We couldn't even reproduce it there. Nobody knew what was going on. They eventually replaced my logic board, only for it to happen again. I mostly gave up and just used my MacBook screen. 

The graphic issues disappeared with the 2018-generation of MacBooks. However the biggest issue was also the weidest: sometimes, after longer use, my MacBook became unusably slow:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh hey kernel_task!<br><br>(I plugged in the LG 5K monitor again.) <a href="https://t.co/E7IDHPfR9d">pic.twitter.com/E7IDHPfR9d</a></p>&mdash; Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1128703168697839617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 15, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Merely seconds after removing the external screen, kernel_task disappeared back into the CPU activity ground-noise. Sometimes I had hours where it worked, other times it happened really fast.

I was never able to reliably reproduce this, nor could Apple Support help. They also claimed to not know anything about this issue.


# 16-inch MacBook & LG UltraFine
When Apple announced the 16-inch MacBook Pro, I just had to get one. I don't enjoy splitting my work across multiple machines and I like to move around in my apartment - so it had to be a portable one. Over the years Apple managed to build beefier and beefier portables, however their eight-core 15-inch MacBook Pro was severely thermal throttled - you could [watch](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-power-gadget.html) how it runs at top speed for a few seconds only to be thermal throttled.

The 16-inch was marketed as ["thicker"](https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20971297/macbook-pro-16-inch-battery-apple-thickness-teardown-ifixit) to fix the throttling, and it delivered! Everything is noticeable faster. It also fixed  my biggest issue with the whole MacBook Pro lineup so far, the dreaded kernel_task that eats up CPU like pac-man eats ghosts. 

In April, I stumbled on a stack exchange entry that seemed to explain what was going on all these years.

>high CPU usage by kernel_task is caused by high Thunderbolt Left Proximity temperature, which is caused by charging and having normal peripherals plugged in at the same time.

I PLUGGED THE SCREEN INTO THE WRONG SIDE. YES.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This finally explains what high kernel_task is, and why it happens.

The 16-inch MacBook doesn't seem to suffer from this temperature sensor misplacement and can drive the LG UltraFine without slowdown on both ends. All generations before do have this issue (tested with 2016 and later, purchased every generation.)

The bad news: The LG can provide 87 watts of power, but the notebook comes with a 96 watt adaptor. This means that the battery is constantly compensating. Play StarCraft for 3 hours and your computer will shut off with a dead battery. Apple recommends to use a separate power adapter.
