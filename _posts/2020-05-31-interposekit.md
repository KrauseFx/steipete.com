I built a thing! [InterposeKit](https://github.com/steipete/InterposeKit) is a modern library to swizzle elegantly in Swift. It is fully written in Swift 5.2+ and works on `@objc dynamic` Swift functions or Objective-C instance methods.

Since everything's [much better declared on the project website](http://interposekit.com/), I'm just writing some random thoughts that didn't the readme on building this.

## GitHub Actions

Wow! I didn't had the time to play with this before, and damn this is ðŸ’– good. GitHub Action is fast, easy to set up, reliable and superbly well integrated, down to automatic badges for CI state.

There are a few annoyances, like now being able to run Docker containers on macOS (this isn't technical, that's just [a money thing](https://github.community/t/why-is-docker-not-installed-on-macos/17017/2)). The default Jazzy setup to generate documentation runs via Docker, so I had to [go through some hoops](https://github.com/steipete/InterposeKit/blob/85f6c2dcc465811048cac0b31c4edc8bb71d4268/Sources/InterposeKit/InterposeKit.swift#L305-L319) to make my project compile on Linux.

## Swift and Type Aliases

It's extremely unfortunate that the `@convention()` modifier can't be used on existing type aliases - this would have made Interpose way more convenient. I'm honestly tempted to write a proposal to get this into Swift. Both because this would be cool, and because I'd be really interested in the learning experience.

## Swift Package Manager

I finally watched [WWDC2019:410 Creating Swift Packages](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/410/) and [WWDC2019:408 Adopting Swift Packages in Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/408/) (Hi Boris!) and I really like SwiftPM. Yes, there's a still a lot to do, but it's getting [Package Resources (SE-0271)](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0271-package-manager-resources.md) with Xcode 12 and the integration with GitHub is nice. Not being allowed to [delete `DerivedData` anymore](https://www.jessesquires.com/blog/2020/02/24/replacing-cocoapods-with-swiftpm/) will be difficult though.

## Class Load Events

`objc_addLoadImageFunc ` is a [big no-no](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1266464092082114561?s=21), and probably [shouldn't even exist in the header](https://twitter.com/jckarter/status/1266466247748677632?s=21) at all. There's `_dyld_register_func_for_add_image` however, which is great. This includes a C callback, and while Swift does a really great  job to make it just blend into the language, this callback is not a block and can't capture state. I eventually found out that I can put everything [into a struct as long as it's all static](https://github.com/steipete/InterposeKit/blob/85f6c2dcc465811048cac0b31c4edc8bb71d4268/Sources/InterposeKit/InterposeKit.swift#L259-L293), to not have this pollute my global namespace.

Why would I need this? There was [a particular bug in Mac Catalyst](/posts/mac-catalyst-crash-hunt/) that required such a trick.

## Swift 5.2 callAsFunction

Well well well... here I was [bitchin'](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1227191768153829376?s=20) about Swift getting useless features, only to be extremely happy about `callAsFunction` a few months later. [It even does generics!](https://github.com/steipete/InterposeKit/blob/85f6c2dcc465811048cac0b31c4edc8bb71d4268/Sources/InterposeKit/InterposeKit.swift#L175-L178)

## imp_implementationWithBlock

`imp_implementationWithBlock` has [no way to undo](https://github.com/steipete/InterposeKit/blob/85f6c2dcc465811048cac0b31c4edc8bb71d4268/Sources/InterposeKit/InterposeKit.swift#L130) or deregister the IMP; so once you submitted a block that captures state, you have a permanent memory leak? Oh well.

# Closing Thoughts

This is my first Swift-specific open source project, apart from the usual gists. Please BE harsh on me, I'd like to learn, I had a lot of fun and built this in a weekend, and it helped me to forget time and space (and current world events) for a bit and just thinker. I'm also sure I got things wrong, so please do tell me what can be made better.
